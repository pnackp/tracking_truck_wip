# IoT-Based Tracking System for Refrigerated Food Transportation

## Overview
This repository contains source code and documentation for a microcontroller-based IoT system developed to monitor the temperature and position of refrigerated goods during transportation.  

The transportation industry currently lacks widely available tracking systems capable of monitoring frozen goods temperature, leading to high import costs and affecting product quality. To address this, the researchers developed a prototype system using microcontrollers to transmit sensor data via IoT networks for real-time display.  

## Key Results
- Accurate internal container temperature measurement: ±0.246°C average error  
- High-accuracy position tracking: 2.11 m average error  
- Continuous operation: ~51.3 hours using a 10,000 mAh power supply  
- Low hardware cost and zero software costs
