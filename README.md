<h1>An IoT-Based Tracking System for Refrigerated Food Transportation </h1>
<h2>With microcontroller </h2>

<a>The transportation industry currently lacks readily available tracking systems capable of monitoring frozen goods temperature, as such systems are not widely distributed, leading to high import costs and affecting product quality. To solve this, the researchers developed a prototype system using microcontrollers to transmit sensor data via IoT networks for real-time display. Results demonstrate the developed system can accurately measure internal container temperature ±0.246°C average error and track position with high accuracy 2.11 m average error. Additionally, the system operates continuously for approximately 51.3 hours with a 10,000 mAh power supply, featuring a low hardware cost that proves highly cost-effective given the achieved performance, alongside zero software costs. Consequently, this system is suitable for further application in industries requiring position tracking and temperature monitoring.<a>
